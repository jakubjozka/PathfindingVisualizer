# Program Name: PathfindingVisualizer

## Specification

PathfindingVisualizer is a WPF application designed to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms in an interactive and intuitive way.
Users can define start and end nodes, place walls or weighted terrain, and modify the grid freely. The application supports several algorithms, including Dijkstra’s, A*, Multi-Target Dijkstra’s, and more.

Once an algorithm is selected, users can watch the pathfinding process unfold in real time. After execution, the path or the entire grid can be cleared for a new run. Additionally, a speed control slider allows tuning of the visualization pace.

## Installation

1. Install **Visual Studio** with the **.NET Desktop Development** workload.
2. Download or copy the `/src/` folder to your computer.
3. Open the solution file (`.sln`) inside the `/src/` folder in Visual Studio.
5. Build and run the project.
